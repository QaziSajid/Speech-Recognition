<b>Target: Voice Assistant to open apps using machine learning</b>
<br><br>
Step 1: Capture voice clip.<br>
Step 2: Link voice clip to application path, by direct machine learning.<br>
Step 3: Design GUI app which remains active in background and starts capturing voice when it hears a certain keyword.<br>
Step 4: Open the requested app.<br><br>

Main problem to avoid: Do not ask user again and again for some action.
Do not convert voice to text. Perform audio feature extraction and then machine learning on those features. Allows diiferent users to customise activation keyword and phrases associated with each app. Also allows certain level of security because of voice recognition.
